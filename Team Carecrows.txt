( • SCENE 1 : Outside HollyOaks Care Home )


A stern looking man in a suit looks at a building that looks to have seen better days. Today is the last day of the HollyOaks Care Home for the Elderly.


Stern Suit: 
Today is the last day of the HollyOaks Care Home for the Elderly.


It is time to decommission a specific carebot that was assigned to the last resident in this place.


The establishment has closed down because funding depleted


and the government decided not to continue the Carebot program since taking care of the elderly to this extent was not profitable.




( • SCENE 2 : Blu’s room - with Blu and Carebot ) 


Blu: 
They are coming to take us away.  I wished we could go and take an adventure somewhere. 


Carebot:
… Where?


Blu: 
In my youth, we would go to the ocean and watch the sunrise.


Carebot:
… Hmmm


Blu: 
I don’t have any family left and you are my only companion left. 


Carebot:
… Family...


Blu: 
And now you are going to leave me too… 


Or not ? Let’s get outta here!




( • SCENE 3 : Inside Blu’s room(different perspective) - with Blu, carebot and Stern Suit - the door is visible )


Stern Suit opens the door to Blu’s room and finds Carebot and Blu there.


Stern Suit: 
Oh good,you’re here. Time to dismantle and goodbye.


Carebot: 
Blu… run… I will fight.


Blu: 
What?!


Carebot: 
RUN!




MINIBOSS FIGHT COMMENCES - TBD




( • SCENE 4 : In the forest - with Blu and Carebot )


Carebot is carrying Blu, as they run through the forest.


They have started on their grand adventure. 


Blu and Carebot have successfully evaded the authorities and now they are navigating their way to the ocean. 


It was nighttime and the forest path seemed eerie. 


As they were walking in the dark forest, they heard muffled noises just a few metres ahead.




( • SCENE 5 : At the edge of the forest outside Happy Babies baby shelter - with Blu and Carebot )


Beyond a bush, across the street, there was a building with a sign “Happy Babies” emblazoned on it. Several dogs barking could be heard from the inside. The shelter seems abandoned.




( • SCENE 6 : Inside Happy Babies baby shelter - with Blu and Carebot )


Blu and Carebot see several  babies inside cages, they look like they are not being cared for.


The cages are labelled with breed names reflective of each baby’s own traits.


(Note to artist: the baby shelter should be reflective of what dog shelters look like but replace dogs with babies. The aforementioned is one idea ^. Please try to make it obvious that “what if you kept your babies encaged and abandon like you encage and abandon dogs. Why treat dogs differently? If this message does not convey well in the art, we will have to stick with dogs. Not every player will be able to understand the point of the scene anyway.)


Blu: 
How sad, these poor animals have been abandoned, just like me.


Carebot:
... Do you want to set them free?


Blu: 
We have to find the keys for the cages! Come on, Carebot! We need to rescue these poor animals!




INVENTORY PUZZLE COMMENCES - TBD




Babies: 
(Speaking baby language)


Blu: 
No need to thank us.


Carebot: 
Do you want to come with us to the sea? It is our grand adventure.




( • SCENE 7 : On their way to the beach - with Blu, Carebot and the babies - You can see the beach from here )


Now, Blu and Carebot’s party has grown. It is nearing sunrise and they are getting closer to their destination.


Carebot: 
I am remembering something. Before, I was sent to take care of others, I had a family. I was different. 


Blu: 
Carebot? What do you mean?


Carebot: 
I don’t actually know. There are fragments of memories. They keep coming.


Blu: 
It’s okay, Carebot. We will handle whatever that is together. Let’s go to the ocean and we will talk about what comes next.


Carebot 
Ok, Blu.




( • SCENE 8 : At the beach in front of the pretty Ocean - with Blu and Carebot - You can hear the babies running around playing)


They reach the ocean and the party watches amazed at the bright vibrant colours that paint the sky. It seems their problems are far away and they will cherish the memory for all their lives.


They are so absorbed that they can’t see a party of enforcement officers approaching them at the back. It is too late and the stern man in the suit yells to them.


Stern Suit: 
Hey!! You are in violation of stealing private government staff and property.  This model health support companion needs to be decommissioned and promptly returned to the lab for dismantlement!!




( • SCENE 9 : At the beach(different perspective) in front of a group of enforcement officers - with Blu, Carebot, Stern Suit and enforcement officers)


Blu: 
Dismantlement? You can’t. I won’t let you. The government has no business in destroying Carebot!


Stern Suit: 
You are wrong there. This is just a robot and you are an old feeble person with abandoned companions. You lot have no use to society. You deplete resources that could better be served for those who deserve it.  All of you are weak and insignificant parasites of society.


Blu: 
How can you say that! Carebot, What are you doing?! Don’t go with him! You will be destroyed!


Carebot: 
It’s okay. They really want me so I need to just leave with them and all of you will be safe.


Blu: 
You are wrong, Carebot! These people always lie. Don’t believe in them! 


The sun had nearly set and the team of officers were ready to capture Carebot until a new party arrived at the beach.


April Cruz:
STOP!!!!!


You have no right to capture them!


( • SCENE 10 : At the beach(different perspective) - with Blu, Carebot, Stern Suit and April Cruz)


A woman shouted at them. She seems very angry.


Apri Cruz:
I am April Cruz, the daughter of Raymond Cruz and I am here to get him back. Your government has made him into an android healthcare worker without telling my family. Leave now. I have already contacted the media so don’t pull any funny business.


April looks at Carebot and her eyes water. She runs to embrace her father in his metal form.




( • SCENE 11 : At the beach(different perspective) - with Blu, Carebot, Stern Suit and April Cruz - April is hugging Carebot)


The stern man glares at her but can’t do anything since it seems April did have back up, which looked like some activist group and a few reporters.


Blu: 
I am so glad for you, Carebot.
